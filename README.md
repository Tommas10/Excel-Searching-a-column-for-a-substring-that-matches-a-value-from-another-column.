# Searching-a-column-for-a-substring-that-matches-a-value-from-another-column.
After opening test.xls To fill in the Result column with values ​​of Third_Value column corresponding to values ​​in the Longer_Value column if the value from the first column was found. 
If more than one was found, I would like to list them with some delimiter.
If substring not matches a value from anither column to write no_match.
